# The Game - a Python Machine Learning Environment


This project developed from a Master's thesis that aimed at creating a primitive platformer python game which could serve as a machine learning environment. This readme covers the instructions on how to run the game and repeat the experiments described in the thesis (or conduct new ones). For a detailed description of the experiments and more info on the game, check the thesis. The learning algorithm is a modification of [this implementation](https://github.com/aleju/mario-ai) of the Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm published in the [Atari paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602).



## The Game

### Requirements
Python version 3.5+ and the PyGame library (version 1.9.3 was used for this project).
